# Introducing React Query

- What is React Query?
    it's a library for fetching data in React applications.

- Why I need a data fetching library?
    1. Since React is a UI library, there is no specific pattern for data fetching.
    2. There are useEffect hooks for data fetching and useState hooks to maintain component state like loading, error or resulting data.
    3. If the data is needed throughout the app, we tend to use state management libraries. Although most of the state management libraries are good for working with client states, they are not great for working with asynchronus or server states. (server states are very different to client states)
